# Getting Started

This will help you install and build your first React Native application.

**Important:** Building Projects whith Native Code.

The instructions are a little different from your development operating system, here we will use **Linux** and **Android** OS.

You can also check the [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) of React Native to install it in the other OS.

## Installing dependencies ðŸ“‹

Follow step by step the [instructions for the installation of dependencies of the official documentation of React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

```
Note: Only the steps of Dependency Installation (Building Projects whith Native Code)
```
## Creating a new application

Use the React Native command line interface to generate a new React Native project called "billmobilefrontend":

```
react-native init billmobilefrontend
```

## Preparing the Android device Using a physical device

You will need to prepare the device to run Android apps for development.

If you have a physical Android device, you can use it for development in place of an AVD by plugging it in to your computer using a USB cable and following the instructions [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device).

```
Note: Choose the Android and Linux option.
```

### Running your React Native application

Run _react-native run-android_ inside your React Native project folder:

```
cd billmobilefrontend

react-native run-android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android shortly.

Note: If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/troubleshooting#content) page.
